                Our team will manually review that your account meets legal requirements (detailed in the disclaimer below).
                You will be notified when the account is validated and will be able to receive payments then.
                <br/>
                We will also notify you if and when we need to gather more information.
                For example, after the first payment we will ask for your banking information so we can do payouts to your bank account.
